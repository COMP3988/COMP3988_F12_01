short term plan
* transition to google cloud platform for GPU access and proper computing resources.
* retrain the same models on GCP to see how performance improves with better hardware.
* conduct controlled experiments with the current models by adjusting key variables, such as the number of training epochs and the dataset size.

client demo plan
* results - rick, josh
* analysis - ariel
* Future Plan: 
    * near-term: tweaking current models.
    * mid-term: combining the two models into a hybrid.
    * long-term: implementing new models (diffusion and transformers).

new model development
* start implementing initial diffusion and transformer models by the end of Week 9.
* popular open-source GitHub repositories that can be forked and adapted.
* maybe: research the possibility of combining Stable Diffusion with GANs.
