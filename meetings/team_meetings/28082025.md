Thursday 28 AUG 9:10
### Agenda
- Running through the presentation for tomorrow

### Approximate time allocations
- 3 mins per person
- Josh might take a bit longer, Ariel and Kyrie a bit shorter

### Practice
- Josh 0:00 (-1 slide, so +2min)
- Ariel 1:20
- Rick 3:30
- Kyrie 7:10
- Jason 10:30
- End 14:00

- Which is over the time limit (+2 min is 16 min)
- Rick and Kyrie artificially stretched out their segments to make up for Ariel and Josh (I forgor that Josh missed a slide) 
- aim to end a little early for Q&A ^^

### Notes
- Chengbo is very hands off with the project so its a little hard to pinpoint our timeline
- Kyrie should mention Xtreme Programming (despite it not being in the marking criteria)
- Mention the person's role before hansding over to make it sound more professional

### Client meeting tomorrow
- not a lot of questions to ask
- do some research and literature review between presentation and client meeting
