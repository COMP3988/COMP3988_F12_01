Thursday 16 OCT 9:00
## Plan for this week
- People who aren't making the models (Kyrie and Jason) start work on the group report
    - We can use last time's report with an acknowledgement
    - Might be nice to explain why we chose to stop working on Unet and P2P - we overestimated time and resources (especially resources) and had to start work on other more complicated models
- Finish training models especially with 3d results

## Plan for tomorrow
- Clarify marks and feedback with tutor
- Rick has a model trained on 200 epochs and will try to evaluate it and present tomorrow

## Report 
- Try to get it done by next Friday 24th October
- Josh will divvy it up by model
