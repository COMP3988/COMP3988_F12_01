Wednesday 10 SEP 9:30 PM - 10:15 PM
## Agendas
- Rehearse/Discuss group project demo + presentation for tutorial on Friday

## Clarifications
- Jason is in Japan so Kyrie will be taking over his slides
    - He will send over notes tomorrow
- Our demo will be **included** in the 15 minutes of the presentation
- We need some sample subsets for pix2pix and U-net on the laptop we're presenting with?

Do we do the demo at the end or in the middle of our slides?
- Middle might make more sense, but putting it at the end makes it easier to manage our time
- We pick the middle
- we can't do prerecorded so we have to do live
- Josh and Rick will each talk about the model they used
- Rick's part might be more interactive since he has 3d slices, while Josh can just send over pngs of his stuff

## Feedback from last task
- Make the project scope statement more specific
- Generally more statistics and more specificity
- Briefly introduce datasets - SynthRAD2025 with MRI-CT pairs
    - Josh used Kaggle dataset - more focused on MRI-CT pairs
    - Rick used the SynthRAD dataset - split into head/neck, thorax, abdomen

## Time distribution
- Demo might take 3 min in the middle of the presentation

- Kyrie (1 slide) - 1 min
- Josh (5 slides) - 3 min 30 sec
- Rick (2 slides) - 2 min
- Demo - 3 min (can shorten by ~30 sec if we place it after explanations)
- Rick (2 slides) - 2 min
- Kyrie (2 slides) - 1 min 30 sec
- Ariel (3 slides) - 2 min
Adds up to exactly 15 minutes - which is cutting it close!!!

## Future planning
- Tomorrow 8:30 PM meeting - we will rehearse the presentation
- Between now and then figure out what we are writing
- Configure laptops so that one of them can run the entire demo
- Josh is sending over results tomorrow afternoon so that Rick can put it into the demo
