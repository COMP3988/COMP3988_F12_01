Thursday 18 SEP 9:30 PM - 10:00 PM
## Agenda
- Prepare for client deployment tomorrow

## Analysis report by Ariel
- Thank you Ariel for writing it up!
- The future plan is to integrate the UNet and Pix-2-Pix model, as the P2P already uses UNet
    - Why? UNet and P2P are used in other more complex models and so improving UNet is going to improve everything else from the bottom up

## Looking at the rubric
- marked out of 5
- someone should write a quick 1-page thing talking about how we responded to Chengbo's feedback

## Planning
- Mention user stories in our intro
- Demonstration with the UNet results side-by-side
- Mention that we used Pix-2-Pix but the results are not amazing
    - Mention the metrics (SSIM etc) and say we didn't have enough computing resources to train (this is true)
- Analysis
- Talk about future planning
    - Start using GPU and start trying to implement transformer and diffusion models
    - We can pick them up again if we need them as part of the others
    - Chengbo seemed to imply he wanted us to research our own models and stuff
        - We can make more basic models first and try to combine them - maybe Diffusion and P2P (GANs)?
