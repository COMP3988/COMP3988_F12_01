## Costs
- Rick has underestimated the cost of the training
- Might be ~150 by the end of the semester
- He has offered to pay the first $50 (and we split the rest) but we need to be more careful in the future
- Try to only use it to train models for sanity checks etc.
    - (the price is 1 dollar an hour and troubleshooting the VM is the same price as training the stuff)

## What Rick has been doing - Transformer models
- Shaoyanpan transformer diffusion model (from that paper!)
- Has had a little trouble setting up the dependencies
- has built the preprocessor but having difficulty getting the code to run

## Diffusion models
- Josh might call Ariel some time tomorrow to work on it

## Client meeting tomorrow
- It's midsem break so we probably don't need to meet anyway
- Nothing to show anyway

## Plan for this week (we want the models okay by next week!)
Ariel
- Look into the repo and see what we need to change

Rick
- Will be in China - firewall issues
- if he can escape the firewall will try to get the transformer-diffusion model ready
- will research how to make the google cloud training process easier

Jason
- Is at Lyra
- Very busy
- Let him know if there's anything miscellaneous (like DevOps stuff!)

Kyrie
- Read the shaoyanpan repository and see if I can get all the ipynb script into one python script
- Try to get a couple other models up and runnable (so Rick can run them on the VM) if he gets firewalled in China
