- Establish development plan by Wednesday 8:30pm
    - Identify frameworks and technology
    - Feature milestones
    - Key user stores
    - Identify programming pairs/triplets
- Slides due Thursday
    - Build understandings first and then meet on Wednesday

## Deadlines
- Sunday: Scope Statement (Ariel)
- Sunday: Plan slides
- Next friday: Plan presentation

### To complete by Thursday
Presentation: 2-3 slides each, 12 slides total, EXCLUDING cover page
- Introduction of the project and stakeholders josh 2
- Scope of the project (and assumptions/limitations) ariel 2-3
- Timeline in suitable form such as Gantt Chart or table (schedules & group meetings & client interactions) rick 1-2
- Responsibility of each member kyrie 2
- Expected outcomes and deliverables jason 3
Slides are to be "concise, clear, and attractive."

## Notes from client
### Methodology
1. Data Acquisition: Utilize paired MRI-CT and CBCT-CT datasets from SynthRAD2025.
2. Preprocessing: Apply deformable registration and normalization techniques.
3. Model Development: Implement deep learning models including U-Net, GANs, and transformer-based architectures, diffusion models
4. Evaluation: Assess image fidelity, anatomical accuracy, and dosimetric relevance.
5. Clinical Validation: Collaborate with radiotherapy centers to validate sCTs in real-world 
planning scenarios.

### Expected outcomes
- High-quality synthetic CT images suitable for clinical radiotherapy planning.
- Improved workflow efficiency and reduced patient radiation exposure.
- Open-source tools contributing to the medical imaging community.

### Timeline
Weeks 1–3: Data collection and preprocessing.
Weeks 4–6: Model development and training.
Weeks 7–9: Evaluation and refinement.
Weeks 10–12: Clinical validation and deliverables.

## To-do later
Go over the development plan for our project and start assigning first programming tasks
- Preprocessing: Get, load, and display dataset (Synthrad 2025)
- Match MRI to CT (possibly Python library)
- Build very simple model (2-3 patients) - baseline
