## Progress
- Josh and Rick have gotten pix2pix and unet models working
- basic right now with no frontend

## Group Report Allocation
Ariel will be doing
- knowledge and tools (that section is mostly research)
- After josh and rick fill out the stuff we can all do plan and risk stuff

Kyrie will do 
- introduction
- conclusion
- ai acknowledgement

Jason will do
- quality of group processes

Josh and Rick:
- system specs and architecture

## Communications
- ask the tutor if she approves of us using discord instead of slack
- if she approves we move onto discord and ignore the slack

## Questions
For the AI models we are investigating, are there any performance benchmarks?
- SSIM 
- peak signal to noise ratio
- synthRAD has metric functions for us already

Should we use jira
- it might be good to just use the kanban

## Client meeting tomorrow
- we have a lot of questions
- Does he have any preferences for which benchmarks for us to use?
- what is he researching? who is his supervisor? 
- what is the future for medical imaging models?

## Presentation due on Sunday
- work on it on sunday
- finish group report by Saturday and work on the presentation on sunday

## Next stage
- Look for solutions to training time - our GPU is not strong enough
- look into cloud stuff since thats cheaper than buying it
    - something has a free trial?
- will be looking to get a diffusion/transform model working next
