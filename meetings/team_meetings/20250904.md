- After Josh and Rick fill out the stuff we can all do plan and risk management

Kyrie will do 
- Introduction
- Conclusion
- AI Acknowledgement

Jason will do

Josh and Rick:
- System specification and Architecture

## Communications
- Ask the tutor if she approves of us using Discord instead of Slack
- If she approves we move onto Discord deprecate Slack usage

## Questions
For the AI models we are investigating, are there any performance benchmarks?
- SSIM 
- Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR)
- SynthRAD2025 has metric functions for us already in their GitHub

Should we use Jira
- It might be good to just use the Kanban board

## Client meeting tomorrow
- We have a lot of questions
- Does he have any preferences for which benchmarks for us to use?
- What is he researching? Who is his supervisor? 
- What is the future for medical imaging models?

## Presentation due on Sunday
- Work on it on sunday
- Finish group report by Saturday and work on the presentation on Sunday

## Next stage
- Look for solutions to training time - our GPU is not strong enough
- Look into cloud solutions since thats cheaper than buying it
    - Maybe look for a free trial
- Will be looking to get a diffusion/transform model working next
