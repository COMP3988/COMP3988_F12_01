Thursday 25 SEP 9:00 PM - 10:15 PM
## Agendas
- plan stuff for the next few weeks
- milestones, deliverables, user stories

## Absences
- Rick is going to NZ and China, will be gone from Saturday 28th to Saturday 11th
- Kyrie won't be here tomorrow
- Josh will be back from China from Wednesday 1st
- Skip the client meeting tomorrow

## Plan
- Ariel and Kyrie need to do some programming since the programming team are away
- Rick can send us a guide for setting up the google cloud stuff (to do the training)
- Can look at other repositories for advice and inspiration
- Ariel and Jason are doing testing (it's mostly done)
- We want to have videos for demonstrations - results, testing, setup, etc.
- Would be good to write bits of the report while we're doing stuff so that it's easier when it's due

## Testing
- Marking criteria on Canvas

## Deadlines
- Next report due on 26th
- Try to get 2 models ready to train by the 11th
- And then focus on one to make really good
- We can split into pairs for the models
    - Josh does diffusion with Ariel and Rick does transformer with Kyrie
    - Hopefully our SSIM gets > 0.7
- However, Chengbo *did* ask us to optimise the Unet and P2P -> get them to 0.6 SSIM as asked
- Make the table summarising pros and cons for the state-of-the-art models

## Timeline
This week: Make the research table for different models
11th September: optimise Unet and P2P (preferably before the transformer/diffusion models)
11th October: make the diffusion and transformer models and train them
26th October: write the report, prepare the presentation

# User stories
- Pretty similar to what we already have
- We're mostly looking for good results - other user stories don't matter as much to the client
- Try and get that SSIM as high as possible!
