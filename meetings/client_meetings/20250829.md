## Questions
Would it be better to aim for one model and go in depth or do attempt multiple models? 
- Select as many as you can, look into strong models such as diffusion etc.
- One model is not enough; we can reproduce several public strong models

Would we have access to any GPU resources?
- No, we will not be supplied computational sources
- Try more lightweight models in the absence of a GPU

Our first delivery is in 3 weeks. What are your expectations?
- Some useful results
- Familiar with data and image processing 
- Familiar with dataset
- 1 or 2 basic models (small scale prototype)

## SynthRAD2025
- SynthRAD2025 has is an ongoing challenge for medical synthesis
- It is an open challenge, and we can try to submit our model to compete in the challenge
- We can publicly release our project code
- If we have a model before the challenge is closed we should try and give it a shot.

### Next week scheduling
2pm next Friday 5th September

### Post-meeting discussion
- We can start with command line
- UI and front end is a secondary priority
