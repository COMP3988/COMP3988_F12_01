# Objective: introduction to the project and its requirements
- We are to generate CT images from MRI sequences
- We have an MRI-CT/CBCT paired database in SynthRAD2025 that we can look at
- A lot of the people also use the Stanford AIMI shared database
- IEEE transactions on medical imaging - exemplar paper to look at 
- SSIM - exemplar for image comparison programs
- We are not given a computer to run the model on
- We can take multiple MRI slices to get better context from which to generate the CT
