# Meeting minutes 17/10/2025

## Result Overview

- Recap of team structure with the models
- Rick achieve 0.95 SSIM, but will show images next week
- Josh trying to achieve 0.8-0.9 SSIM. still haven’t trained 3d model, since still trying to get GPU resources
- We definitely have one model at around 0.95 SSIM. we will supply the images by next week Friday.

## Next steps

- If model is 3d, if can achieve SSIM > 0.95, then can also can use other metrics like PSNR.
- Different organs and slices to demonstrate the model will perform well across different organs/slices
- Inference time is currently around 12-14 seconds. we care more about the image quality than the inference time so it isn’t an issue.

# Deployment Plan

- Present analysis and figure slides to show results next week.
- For client deployment, then slides should be enough.
