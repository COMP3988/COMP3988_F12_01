# Meeting minutes 24/10/2025

### What does the client want in the demo next week?
- Next week we should show Chengbo the methods we used 
- table comparing different methods
- tell him in as much detail as possible

### Showing Chengbo the image side-by-side
- the images look quite different, so it seems the training failed
- Structurally similar but there are still some differences - structures are acceptable if we fix the colours
- colour looks very different though.
- hopefully we can correct for the colour differences.
- we can focus on metric values - e.g. SSIM > .8

### Are we prioritising one or the other or are we focusing on MRIs over CBCTs?
- MRI-CT is most important translation as MRIs are not radioactive
- as long as the MRI-CT translation is good then we will not be marked much lower for an incomplete or non-SOTA CBCT-CT translation.
