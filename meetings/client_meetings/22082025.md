## Questions

### In detail, what are we supposed to do?
- Much of the literature is old - it has been published for more than 10 years
- some papers have been published in the last 3-5 years, unsing more advanced models
    - our job is to do lit review of those papers and look at the open source code to make more advanced models

### who are our stakeholders?
- Our client is just Chengbo lmao
- Stakeholders - the university of sydney
- data is open source as well

### Give us an idea of your ideal results.
- We do not need a pretty front end
- this will be a research software and focuses on algorithms
- focus is on complexity of models and accuracy of results rather than us

### so would a bash script be fine as a unser interface?
- I think he doesn't know what Bash is
- Command line might suffice (but if we can we should probably make some sort of workable interface anyway)

### Future client meetings
- held at 2:00 PM on fridays every week
