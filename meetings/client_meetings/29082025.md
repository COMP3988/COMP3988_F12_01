## Questions
Would it be better to aim for one model and go in depth or do attempt multiple models? 
- select as many as you can, look into strong models such as diffusion etc.
- one model is not enough; we can reproduce several public strong models

Can we please have some sort of GPU please
- no, we will not be supplied computational sources
- try more lightweight models in the absence of a GPU

Our first delivery is in 3 weeks. What are your expectations?
- some useful results
- familiar with data and image processing 
- familiar with dataset
- 1 or 2 basic models (small scale prototype)

## SYNTHRAD2025
- SYNTHRAD2025 has is an ongoing challenge for medical synthesis
- it is an open challenge, and we can try to submit our model to compete in the challenge
- we can publicly release the stuff we write :)
- If we have a model before the challenge is closed we should try and give it a shot.

### Next week scheduling
2pm next friday 5th SEP

### Post-meeting discussion
- we can start with command line
- no need for too much UI, right?
