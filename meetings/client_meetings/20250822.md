## Questions

### In detail, what are we supposed to do?
- Much of the literature is old - it has been published for more than 10 years
- Some papers have been published in the last 3-5 years, using more advanced models
    - Our job is to do lit review of those papers and look at the open source code to make more advanced models

### Who are our stakeholders?
- Our client is Chengbo Wang

- Stakeholders - the University of Sydney
- Data is open source as well

### Give us an idea of your ideal results.
- We do not need a pretty front end
- This will be a research software and focuses on algorithms
- Focus is on complexity of models and accuracy of results

### So would a bash script be fine as a user interface?
- Command line might suffice (but if we can we should probably make some sort of workable interface anyway)

### Future client meetings
- Held at 2:00 PM on Fridays every week
